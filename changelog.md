### Bug

- When a user deletes a category, users must first reassign all transactions to another category.
- After adding a transaction, accounts must be properly updated without refreshing the page.
- When adding transactions to categories without sufficient assigned funds, it incorrectly handles decimal places (e.g. - Â£146.67000000000002).When deleted transaction, still does not retain correct decimal places.
- Balances in accounts should not be negative.
- Persistent modal error messages. Should reset after closing.
