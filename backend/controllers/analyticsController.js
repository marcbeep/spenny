/*
For each type of analytic, create corresponding functions in an analyticsController file. These functions will handle the logic for calculating, updating, and retrieving analytics data. Example functions might include:

calculateTotalSpend
calculateSpendingByCategory
calculateNetWorth
calculateIncomeVsExpenses
calculateSavingsRate

Each function will fetch relevant transaction and account data, perform calculations, and update the analytics document for the user.
